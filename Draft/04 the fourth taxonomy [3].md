In developing the taxonomies described above (of regime, of class, and of soul), Plato has secretly woven an implicit fourth taxonomy into the mix: a taxonomy of social allegiances. These allegiances are ranked implicitly according to their effectiveness at retaining the bonds of social order, from most to least effective: city, class, family, and self. This implicit taxonomy is deduced from the structure of the classes in the Kallipolis. Each class inherits its allegiances from the class above it, effectively creating patrimonial allegiances. The ruling class is allegiant to the city and their class; the guardians are allegiant to the city, their class, and their family; and the artisans are allegiant to the city, their class, their families, and their selves. However, each class also has a slight imbalance in these allegiances, due primarily to the fact that each class corresponds to an imbalance in the tripartite soul. Therefore the ruling class is most allegiant to the city beacuse reason and justice rule their souls; the guardian class is most allegiant to family because spirit and honor rule their souls; and the artisan class is most allegient to the self because appetite and desire rule their souls. The allegiance to class, it should be noted, remains constant across the board because each individual is born into their class by nature and as such has implicit, unchallenged allegiance to their class.
