To begin, it is widely known that Plato developed three crucial taxonomies in the Republic: the tripartite soul, the tripartite polis, and the five regimes. Plato’s notion of the tripartite soul—developed in Book IV by Socrates and his interlocutors, Glaucon and Adeimantus—explicitly divides the soul into three parts, ranking each by their virtue in descending order: first, the rational part; second, the spirited part; third, the appetitive part. Next, by projecting the tripartite soul onto a model of the polis, Socrates and his interlocutors establish a ranking of the classes of the Kallipolis, forming a tripartite polis composed of rulers, guardians, and artisans. These classes each naturally correspond to a part of the tripartite soul: the ruling class should be governed by reason, the guardian class by spirit, and the artisan class by appetite. Additionally, in Book VIII, Plato develops a taxonomy of five political regimes, ranked according to their virtue in descending order: aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny. Each of these political regimes resembles a balance of the parts of the tripartite soul in the polis; the more balanced the soul, the more effective the regime. As important as these taxonomies may be, philosophy’s focus on them has led us to miss an additional implicit taxonomy; as a result, we seem to have missed the purpose of these taxonomies entirely.
